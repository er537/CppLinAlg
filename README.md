# CppLinAlg
A C++ impementation of Matrix and Vector classes, with MATLAB like functionality. Capabilities include solving linear systems using GMRES and CG solvers and basic matrix arithmetic.

use_vectors.cpp demonstrates the use of the functions in the Matrix.cpp and Vector.cpp files.

plot_res is a MATLAB function that can be used to plot the residuals at each iteration of each of the solvers.
