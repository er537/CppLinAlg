# CppLinAlg
A C++ impementation of Matrix and Vector classes, with MATLAB like functionality. Capabilities include solving linear systems using GMRES and CG solvers and basic matrix arithmetic.

Matrix.cpp and Vector.cpp contain methods belonging the the matrix and vector classes, including the GMRES and CG algorithms for solving linear systems, a determinant calculator and reshaping functions. 

use_vectors.cpp demonstrates the use of these functions. 

plot_res is a MATLAB function that can be used to plot the residuals at each iteration of the linear solvers.
